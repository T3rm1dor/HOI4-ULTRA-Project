 infantry_guns_smg_desc: "During World War I, submachine guns (SMGs) were introduced as a new type of firearm for close-quarters combat. These weapons fired pistol ammunition, such as the 9mm Parabellum cartridge, and had a relatively low rate of fire, usually around 500-600 rounds per minute. WW1 era SMGs were made of metal and wood, and were simple and rugged in design, intended to be easy to use and maintain on the battlefield. They were a significant advancement in firearms technology, providing soldiers with a more effective weapon for close-range combat than the traditional bolt-action rifles of the time."
 infantry_squad_4_desc: "These mass-produced SMGs are designed to be simple and easy to manufacture, using fewer and less expensive materials than more high-end firearms. They typically feature simple blowback operating systems, metal and wood construction, and magazine capacities of around 20-30 rounds. They fire pistol ammunition, such as the 9mm Parabellum cartridge, and have a low rate of fire, usually around 500-600 rounds per minute."
 infantry_guns_impr_smg_desc: "These weapons, high-quality submachine guns (SMGs), are designed to be accurate, reliable, and easy to use in close-quarters combat situations. In addition to their durability and reliability, they are also designed to be comfortable and ergonomic for the shooter. Overall, these SMGs are a valuable asset for soldiers in close-quarters combat, as they provide a reliable and effective weapon for engaging enemy targets at short range."
 infantry_guns_assault_carbine_desc: "Assault Carbine"
 infantry_guns_assault_rifle_desc: "Assault rifles are a type of firearm that is designed for use in close-quarters combat and other short-range shooting situations. They are characterized by their intermediate cartridge, which allows assault rifles to be more compact and lightweight than traditional rifles, while still providing sufficient power and accuracy for medium-range shooting. They are versatile weapons that can be used in a wide range of situations, including close-quarters combat, urban warfare, and other scenarios."
 infantry_guns_battle_rifle_desc: "Early battle rifles are designed for use in medium to long-range combat situations and are characterized by their full-size cartridges. However, they were large and heavy, have significant recoil, and were expensive to produce and maintain. They also have lower reliability compared to other types of firearms, such as assault rifles or submachine guns. Despite these issues, early battle rifles have several advantages that make them valuable tools."
 infantry_guns_adv_battle_rifle_desc: "Modern battle rifles are known for their range, power, accuracy, versatility, and reliability. They are effective at medium to long range, typically out to 600 meters or more, and are chambered for full-size cartridges which provide them with more power and penetration than smaller caliber firearms. They are also accurate and versatile, able to be used in a variety of combat situations, and are designed to be reliable in a variety of conditions."

 DESIGNER_HELP_TEXT: "General Principles:\n- Adding additional members to a squad decreases its overall efficiency.\n- The Squad Leader, NCO, and any specialists (such as a machine gunner or marksman) do not contribute significantly to the squad's hit points. Normal line units are essential.\n- The Squad Leader and NCO slots double the defense and breakthrough bonuses of SMGs or assault rifles.\n- General purpose machine guns have a greater impact on a squad's efficiency than lighter LMGs."
