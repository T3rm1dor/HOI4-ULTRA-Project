 GER_mefo_bills_mission_desc:0 "In order to fund our growing military industry, and to keep this secret from British and French eyes, we have been forced to use a balance sheet entity to route payments to in the form of promissory notes. If we do not use our political connections to extend the due dates of these notes, we will be forced to repay them and will no longer receive their benefits."
