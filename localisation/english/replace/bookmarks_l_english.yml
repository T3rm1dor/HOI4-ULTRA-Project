 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1917 Finland declared independence from Russia. This was followed by a bloody War of Independence against the Bolshevik-backed Finnish Reds that culminated in the signing of a peace treaty with Soviet Russia in Tartu in 1920. \n\nIt has now been almost 20 years of peace, and war might again be brewing in the horizon. Finland puts her trust in her Nordic orientation and non-aggression pact with Soviet Russia, and the ability of the League of Nations to preserve peace, but will this be enough?"
